# Technigo React Starter App

This app has been generated using `create-react-app`, then cleaned up a little so we have a project with just the elements we need to get started.

Add components in the `src` folder and use them in `src/app.js` to get started.

## Usage

1. On GitHub, click the 'use this template' button to create a new repo on your account
1. Clone the new repo to your computer
1. Install required dependencies with npm: `npm install`
1. Start the project: `npm start`

Alternatively, if you don't want a new git repo on your account;

1. Download & extract the [latest release](https://github.com/Technigo/react-starter/releases/latest) from GitHub
1. Open the directory in the terminal: `cd /path/to/react-starter`
1. Install required dependencies with npm: `npm install`
1. Start the project: `npm start`
