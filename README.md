### Link to deployed site:
https://wave-finder.netlify.app/

We have built **Wave Finder**. A community site for people who surf (or would like to try) and get recommendations on where to do so. Our vision was to create a place for where people can get inspiration and the opportunity to inspire others. 
If a visitor choose to register and become a member they will be able to like posts, save their favourite tips and contribute by posting their own recommendations. They will also be able to edit/delete posts that they have created.
If they chose not to register they will be able to read posts and articles.

The user can filter posts by *creation date, most likes, location and surf level*.

##  Technological stack for front-end
- Frontend in React
- Redux
- Navigation using React Router

The site is connected to an external weather API so that the user can check the weather forecast for a destination of their choosing.
